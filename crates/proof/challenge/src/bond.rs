//! Bond lifecycle management.
//!
//! The [`BondManager`] tracks dispute games through a multi-phase credit
//! claim lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. **[`NeedsResolve`](BondPhase::NeedsResolve)** — wait for the game's
//!    dispute period to expire, then call `resolve()`.
//! 2. **[`NeedsUnlock`](BondPhase::NeedsUnlock)** — call `claimCredit()`
//!    to trigger `DelayedWETH.unlock()`.
//! 3. **[`AwaitingDelay`](BondPhase::AwaitingDelay)** — wait for the
//!    `DelayedWETH` delay to elapse.
//! 4. **[`NeedsWithdraw`](BondPhase::NeedsWithdraw)** — call `claimCredit()`
//!    again to complete the withdrawal.
//!
//! A comma-separated list of addresses is provided via the
//! `BASE_CHALLENGER_BOND_CLAIM_ADDRESSES` env var. The manager tracks any
//! game whose onchain `bondRecipient` matches one of those addresses,
//! regardless of the game's resolution outcome (`CHALLENGER_WINS` or
//! `DEFENDER_WINS`). This allows claiming bonds both for games won by the
//! challenger and games proposed by addresses in the claim set.
//!
//! During startup recovery, `zkProver` is also checked against the claim
//! addresses to recover pre-resolve challenged games, since `bondRecipient`
//! is only updated to the challenger's address during `resolve()`. For
//! already-resolved games matched solely via `zkProver`, the onchain
//! `bondRecipient` is re-verified against the claim set before tracking.
