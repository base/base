//! Game scanner for the challenger service.
//!
//! Scans the [`DisputeGameFactory`](base_proof_contracts::DisputeGameFactoryClient)
//! for dispute games requiring validation. Each game is evaluated through a
//! two-stage filter:
//!
//! 1. **Status** — must be `IN_PROGRESS` ([`STATUS_IN_PROGRESS`]).
//! 2. **Challenge state** — `zkProver` must be `Address::ZERO` (unchallenged).
//!
//! Games passing both filters are returned as [`CandidateGame`] structs.
