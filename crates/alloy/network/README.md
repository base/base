# op-alloy-network

Optimism blockchain RPC behavior abstraction.

This crate contains a simple abstraction of the RPC behavior of an
Op-stack blockchain. It is intended to be used by the Alloy client to
provide a consistent interface to the rest of the library, regardless of
changes the underlying blockchain makes to the RPC interface.
