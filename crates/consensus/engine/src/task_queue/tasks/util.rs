/// This is a utility function that:
/// 1. Creates and executes a [`BuildTask`] to initiate block building
/// 2. Creates and executes a [`SealTask`] to seal the block, referencing the initiated payload
///
/// This pattern is commonly used for Holocene deposits-only fallback and other scenarios
/// where a build-then-seal workflow is needed.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `state` - Mutable reference to the engine state
/// * `engine` - The engine client
/// * `cfg` - The rollup configuration
/// * `attributes` - The payload attributes to build
/// * `is_attributes_derived` - Whether the attributes were derived or created by the sequencer
