# `base-execution-txpool`

Transaction pool for Base.

## Overview

Extends Reth's transaction pool with Base-specific validation and ordering for the Base node.
`BaseTransactionValidator` enforces L1 data fee checks and Base-specific validity rules.
`BaseOrdering` and `TimestampOrdering` provide customizable transaction prioritization strategies.
Also includes a `BuilderApiImpl` for builder-specific pool management.

### Pluggable builder wire format

`ValidatedTransaction<E>` is the payload of `base_insertValidatedTransaction`, the endpoint mempool
nodes use to forward transactions to a builder. `E` carries additional wire fields and defaults to
`NoExtensions`, which encodes to exactly the same bytes as a struct without the field at all — so
the default is wire-compatible in both directions with peers that predate the parameter.

Downstream node builds substitute their own payload by implementing
`ValidatedTransactionExtensions<T>`, then registering the generic monomorphizations:

```rust,ignore
use base_execution_txpool::{
    BuilderApiImpl, BuilderApiServer, DEFAULT_MAX_VALIDITY_PREDICATES, ExtensionError,
    ValidatedTransactionExtensions,
    ValiditySignatureMode,
};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct MyExtensions {
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none", default)]
    my_field: Option<u64>,
}

impl ValidatedTransactionExtensions<MyPooledTx> for MyExtensions {
    fn extract(tx: &ValidPoolTransaction<MyPooledTx>) -> Self { /* ... */ }
    fn apply(self, tx: MyPooledTx, mode: ValiditySignatureMode) -> Result<MyPooledTx, ExtensionError> { /* ... */ }
}

// Builder (ingress) side, in place of the stock `BuilderApiExtension`:
let api = BuilderApiImpl::<_, MyExtensions>::with_extensions(pool, true, DEFAULT_MAX_VALIDITY_PREDICATES);
modules.merge_configured(api.into_rpc())?;

// Mempool (egress) forwarding is provided by `base-tx-forwarding`.
```

Extension payloads must serialize as a JSON map (a braced struct, not a unit struct) and must avoid
`u128`/`i128` fields, which `serde_json` cannot represent through `#[serde(flatten)]`.

### Signed validity predicates

`TransactionValidity` carries off-chain predicates separately from the signed Ethereum
transaction. The transaction signature alone does **not** authorize those predicates.
Anyone holding the raw transaction can otherwise add a state predicate that delays
inclusion until their front-run has changed a pool's reserves. This can aid a sandwich
within the user's on-chain slippage limit; it does not change their signed calldata.

Use the shared `--validity-signature-mode off|verify-if-present|required` option
on forwarding ingress nodes and builders. It defaults to `off`: unsigned and signed
predicates are accepted without signature verification. Supplied signatures, even invalid
ones, are preserved for forwarding; malformed wire encodings and invalid predicate
parameters are still rejected. On builders the mode covers both
`base_sendRawTransactionValidity` and `base_insertValidatedTransaction`.

In `off` mode, nodes accept signed clients during rollout, but do not authenticate them.
Deploy `verify-if-present` to **every** ingress and builder to verify supplied signatures
while continuing to accept unsigned predicates. Migrate wallets and load clients to
signing, observe signed/unsigned admission counters, then switch the fleet to `required`.
Required mode rejects any non-empty predicate batch without valid user authorization.
Plain transactions need no extra signature.
Query nodes proxy sidecars unchanged and leave policy to the upstream sequencer.

**Off and optional verification modes are compatibility stages, not sandwich protection.**
As long as unsigned predicates are accepted, an intermediary can remove a
signature and submit different unsigned predicates. Do not claim protection
until required mode is enforced on every relevant admission path.

#### Wallet signing contract

Sign the EIP-712 digest returned by `ValidityAuthorization::signing_hash` using
`eth_signTypedData_v4` (not `personal_sign`). Submit the signature as
`validity_signature` alongside `validity` in the RPC options or builder payload.
It uses Alloy's signature JSON object (`r`, `s`, and `yParity` hex quantities).
The domain is `{ name: "Base Transaction Validity", version: "1", chainId }`;
`chainId` is the transaction's chain ID. There is no verifying contract.

```text
ValidityPredicate(uint8 kind,uint8 operator,address account,uint256 slot,uint256 mask,uint256 value)
ValidityAuthorization(bytes32 transactionHash,ValidityPredicate[] validity)
```

`transactionHash` hashes the complete signed EIP-2718 transaction envelope.
`kind` is balance = 0, storage = 1, block number = 2, flashblock index = 3, nonce = 4.
`operator` is `<` = 0, `<=` = 1, `=` = 2, `!=` = 3, `>` = 4, `>=` = 5.
Balance and nonce predicates use `account`; storage uses `account`, `slot`, and `mask`.
Nonce predicates read the account's protocol nonce, not an EIP-8130 channel nonce.
Unused fields are zero; omitted storage masks become `U256::MAX`.
`ValidityPredicateKind` and `ValidityOperator` define these explicit wire IDs.
All fields participate in each predicate's EIP-712 struct hash. Sort the typed
predicates by their struct hashes in ascending byte order before signing;
`ValidityAuthorization::canonical_predicates` builds this wallet-facing array.
Retain duplicates. Conjunction permutations produce the same digest; adding,
removing, or changing a predicate changes it. Evaluation uses its independent
cheap-first ordering and does not affect the signing contract.

Verification recovers the actual envelope sender rather than trusting the builder
payload's `sender`, and rejects high-s signatures. Only sender-address secp256k1
authorization is supported; contract wallets or EIP-8130 actors without that
key cannot use signed sidecars. Deposits and unprotected legacy transactions
have no chain-bound signing domain and cannot authorize signed predicates.
Shadow-only predicate injection is incompatible with signature enforcement.
Predicates remain builder-side metadata, not on-chain consensus rules: a holder
can still strip the entire sidecar and submit the underlying plain transaction.
This feature prevents unauthorized predicate attachment, not all sandwich attacks.

`ValidityAuthorization::validate_recovered` reuses the sender recovered by raw
ingress. Builder-wire admission uses `validate` to check the envelope sender.
Both return an opaque `ValidatedValidity`, bound to the transaction hash, which
`with_validity` requires before attachment. This witness is not deserializable.
Builders verify incoming wire signatures in `verify-if-present` and `required`;
`off` preserves them without verification. A `ValidatedValidity` records policy admission,
not proof that its signature was verified.

`txpool.validity_signature.rejected{site,reason}` records bounded rejection reasons
at `ingress` and `builder`, independently of generic extension errors.
`txpool.validity_signature.accepted{site,signature}` separates signed and unsigned
sidecars to help operators assess migration readiness. RPC signature errors carry
the same stable rejection reason in their `data` field.

## Usage

Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
base-execution-txpool = { workspace = true }
```

```rust,ignore
use base_execution_txpool::{BaseOrdering, BaseTransactionPool, BaseTransactionValidator};

let pool = Pool::new(
    BaseTransactionValidator::new(client, evm),
    BaseOrdering::default(),
    config,
);
```
