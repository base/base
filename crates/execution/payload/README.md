# `base-execution-payload-builder`

Payload builder for Base.

## Overview

Implements Base payload building and validation for the Base execution node. The
`BasePayloadBuilder` assembles new execution payloads from transaction pool contents and
`BasePayloadBuilderAttributes` received from the consensus layer. `BaseExecutionPayloadValidator`
verifies
built payloads against consensus rules. Also provides data availability configuration via
`BaseDAConfig` for fee calculation.

Resource metering by opcode is an optional native-builder admission guardrail. A versioned
schedule converts `meterBundle` opcode, precompile, and pseudo-opcode aggregates into
independent resource-unit dimensions. The builder can observe those budgets in dry-run or
skip over-budget transactions in enforce mode. This does not change protocol gas, fees, or
validity.

## Usage

Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
base-execution-payload-builder = { workspace = true }
```

```rust,ignore
use base_execution_payload_builder::BasePayloadBuilder;

let builder = BasePayloadBuilder::new(evm_config, payload_validator);
let payload = builder.build_payload(attrs, best_payload)?;
```
