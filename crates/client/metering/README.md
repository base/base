# base-metering

Metering RPC for Base node. Provides RPC methods for measuring transaction and block execution timing.

## RPC Methods

### `base_meterBundle`

Simulates and meters a bundle of transactions.

**Parameters:**
- `bundle`: Bundle object containing transactions to simulate

**Returns:**
- `MeterBundleResponse`: Contains per-transaction results, total gas used, execution times

### `base_meterBlockByHash`

Re-executes a block by hash and returns timing metrics.

**Parameters:**
- `hash`: Block hash (B256)

**Returns:**
- `MeterBlockResponse`: Contains timing breakdown for signer recovery, EVM execution, and state root calculation

### `base_meterBlockByNumber`

Re-executes a block by number and returns timing metrics.

**Parameters:**
- `number`: Block number or tag (e.g., "latest")

**Returns:**
- `MeterBlockResponse`: Contains timing breakdown for signer recovery, EVM execution, and state root calculation

### `base_meteredPriorityFeePerGas`

Meters a bundle and returns a recommended priority fee based on recent block congestion.

**Parameters:**
- `bundle`: Bundle object containing transactions to simulate

**Returns:**
- `MeteredPriorityFeeResponse`: Contains metering results plus priority fee recommendation

**Response:**
```json
{
  "bundleGasPrice": "0x...",
  "bundleHash": "0x...",
  "results": [...],
  "totalGasUsed": 21000,
  "totalExecutionTimeUs": 1234,
  "priorityFee": "0x5f5e100",
  "blocksSampled": 1,
  "resourceEstimates": [
    {
      "resource": "gasUsed",
      "thresholdPriorityFee": "0x3b9aca00",
      "recommendedPriorityFee": "0x5f5e100",
      "cumulativeUsage": "0x1e8480",
      "thresholdTxCount": 5,
      "totalTransactions": 10
    },
    {
      "resource": "executionTime",
      ...
    },
    {
      "resource": "dataAvailability",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Meter the bundle to get resource consumption (gas, execution time, DA bytes)
2. Meter the latest block to get historical transaction data
3. For each resource type, run the estimation algorithm:
   - Walk from highest-paying transactions, subtracting usage from remaining capacity
   - Stop when adding another tx would leave less room than the bundle needs
   - The last included tx's fee is the threshold
4. Return the maximum fee across all resources as `priorityFee`
