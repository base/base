# Account Abstraction (EIP-4337) Configuration
#
# Copy this file to aa-config.toml and customize for your environment.
#
# Usage:
#   base-reth-node node --aa-config /path/to/aa-config.toml

# Required: URL of the TIPS ingress service for submitting user operations
# This is the bundler endpoint that receives and processes user operations
tips_url = "http://localhost:8080"

# Optional: Enable debug logging for AA operations (default: false)
# Set to true for verbose logging during development
debug = false

# Optional: Number of blocks to look back when searching for UserOperation events
# This is used as a fallback when the AA indexer ExEx is not installed.
# Higher values allow finding older operations but increase query time.
# Default: 1000 blocks
user_op_event_lookback_blocks = 1000
